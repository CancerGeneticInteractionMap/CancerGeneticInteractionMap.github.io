Almost twenty years after sequencing the human genome, understanding the complex genetics of quantitative phenotypes remains a major challenge in biology and medicine. This is in large parts due to extensive redundancies, synergisms and context-dependent gene functions. Whilst recent efforts to map all genetic interactions in yeast produced unprecedented insights, similarly comprehensive efforts in human cells lack feasibility so far, mainly due to (i) the large size of the human genome and (ii) limitations inherent to genome perturbation methods. Exploiting new library generation technologies, which we developed to increase screening scalability, the CGIM aims to perform comprehensive SpCas9-based mapping of cell fitness-related genetic interactions in human cancer cells.
