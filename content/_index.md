Almost two decades after sequencing the human genome, understanding the complex genetics of quantitative phenotypes remains a major challenge in biology and medicine. This is in large parts due to extensive redundancies, synergisms and context-dependent gene functions. Whilst recent efforts to map all genetic interactions (GIs) in yeast produced unprecedented biological insights, similarly comprehensive approaches in human cells lack feasibility so far, mainly due to (i) the large size of the human genome and (ii) limitations inherent to genome perturbation methods. Exploiting new library generation technologies, the goal of the CGIM is to perform comprehensive SpCas9-based mapping of genetic interactions in human cells. We will use pairwise gRNA combinations to perturb millions of human gene pairs in cellular models of colon, lung and pancreatic cancer, the three leading causes of cancer-related death in Western countries. Data interpretation and downstream functional work is faciliated by focussing on important cancer pathways and on clinical challenges (druggable genome). GI profiling is harnessed for biological discovery and therapeutic target identification at multiple levels. First, genome-wide combinatorial surveys for GIs involving cancer pathways give new insights into the composition and functional organization of key oncogenic pathways. New pathway components,  synergisms, redundancies and hierarchies within pathways, signaling modulators as well as cross-talk between pathways will be uncovered. Second, GI mapping combined with analysis of interaction profile similarity is exploited to predict the participation of genes in signaling pathways or cellular processes. Coupled with spatial enrichment analyses of biological processes in networks, these efforts will annotate the function of uncharacterized genes and predict novel function for known genes in an unbiased manner. Third, GIs across large cell line panels and entities are validated to explore molecular and cellular context-dependencies, aiming at better understanding tissue-specific differences in tumorigenesis and the organization of signaling pathways. Finally, the CGIM will probe more millions of interactions involving FDA-approved drug target genes across entities. Aiming at uncovering new avenues to indirectly target undruggable mutations, as well as new synthetic vulnerabilities for combinatorial drug repurposing, which will be tested in preclinical models. The CGIM project represents the largest genetic interaction screening effort in human cells to date. It promises to give multifaceted insights into the biological underpinnings of human cancer and to uncover new avenues for therapeutic intervention.
