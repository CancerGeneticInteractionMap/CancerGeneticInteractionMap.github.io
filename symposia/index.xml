Running over 3 days and 3 nights, we’ll begin with a day of talks, networking, and discussion before getting down to the hacking itself. For the Hackathon we’ll prepare a previously unseen imaging dataset. Working in groups, your task will be to develop novel software and analysis techniques to extract information from the dataset.</description></item><item><title>CytoData 2016 Hackaton - by Carpenter Lab</title><link>http://cytodata.org/symposia/2016/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://cytodata.org/symposia/2016/</guid><description>Researchers mining image data are gaining momentum: papers are shifting from proof-of-principle to biological discovery. But we are not yet much of a true community, beyond reading each others’ papers and a few pairwise interactions at conferences. We would like to change this by bringing everyone together in the same room! Collectively, we have tremendous knowledge and insights into this challenging field.
